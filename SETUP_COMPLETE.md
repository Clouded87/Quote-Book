# âœ… Configuration Complete!

Your Quote-Book project has been successfully reconfigured for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Firebase Import Fix
- âœ… `main.js`: Changed imports from `./node_modules/firebase/*` to `firebase/*`
- âœ… `script.js`: Changed imports from `./node_modules/firebase/*` to `firebase/*`

### 2. Build Configuration
- âœ… Created `vite.config.js` with proper settings for GitHub Pages
- âœ… Updated `package.json` with build scripts and module type

### 3. Git Configuration
- âœ… Created `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules/` and `dist/`

### 4. CI/CD Setup
- âœ… Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for automatic deployment
- âœ… Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` with deployment instructions

## What Was The Problem?

The original code imported Firebase from `./node_modules/firebase/*` which works locally but **fails on static hosting** like GitHub Pages because:
- `node_modules` folder is not deployed
- Browsers can't resolve bare module specifiers without a bundler

## The Solution

**Vite bundler** now:
1. Resolves Firebase imports from `node_modules`
2. Bundles all dependencies into a single JavaScript file
3. Creates production-ready files in the `dist/` folder

## Next Steps

### Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000 to test

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
3. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
4. Push to `main` branch - deployment happens automatically!

**Option 2: Manual**
```bash
npm run build
# Upload contents of dist/ folder to your hosting
```
